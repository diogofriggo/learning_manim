# Learning manim

manim is the mathematical animation library developed by Grant Sanderson (author of the youtube channel called [3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw))

This repo contains some of my attempts at producing manim animations!

The [pythagoras proof example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGs9ZBdUOf8) was created based on the tutorials at [TheoremOfBeethoven's channel] (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxiWCEdx7aY88bSEUgLOC6A) and it was my main source for learning manim, I cannot recommend it enough if you're interested in the library!
