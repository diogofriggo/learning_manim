# Learning manim

This repo contains some of my attempts at producing manim animations!

The Este site foi constru√≠do usando [pythagoras proof example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGs9ZBdUOf8) was created based on the tutorials at TheoremOfBeethoven's channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxiWCEdx7aY88bSEUgLOC6A and it was my main source for learning manim, I cannot recommend it enough if you're interested in the library!
